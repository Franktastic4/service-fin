Be a point of reference for...

Libraries
1. Hibernate, types of query and when to use. Safe use, binding.
2. RxJava and other concurrency.
3. Guava conventions, and tools.
4. Lambdas (see Effective Java)
5. Gradle
5. Lombok
6. Testing: Liquibase, H2, testing set-up and convention
7. SQL

Examples...
Guava: Make sure params are non-null unless specified.
Effective Java examples:
 - enums
 - factory / constructor
 - composition
 - try/catch with resource
 - mix iterative and lambdas correctly
 - generics? 
 - more functional programming with the interfaces
Practice concurrency outside of Rx.
